# Survival Prediction of Lung Cancer Patients Based on Different Feature Selection Methods Using DeepSurv Models
Although many studies have been conducted on survival prediction, most of them have focused on the diversity of models, and few have compared the performance using various feature selection techniques.
In this study, to predict the survival rate of lung cancer patients, we applied several feature selection methods-including a variance-based univariate method, specific gene selection, and KEGG pathway selection-and compared their impact on prediction performance.

## The cancer dataset used
- LUAD - Lung Adenocarcinoma
- LUSC - Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## Feature selection
- Variance-based univariate selection
- Specific gene selection
- KEGG pathway selection - cancer
- KEGG pathway selection - small cell lung cancer
