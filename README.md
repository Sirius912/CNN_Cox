# Survival Prediction of Lung Cancer Patients Based on Different Feature Selection Methods Using CNN-Cox Models
Although extensive research has been conducted on survival prediction, most studies have focused on diversifying model architectures rather than comparing the effects of different feature selection methods. 
Therefore, in this study, we apply various feature selection techniques to the survival prediction of lung cancer patients and investigate which method yields the best predictive performance.
